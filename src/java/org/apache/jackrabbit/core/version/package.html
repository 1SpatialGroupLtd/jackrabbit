The version storage is currently implement using the normal storage of the
repository. For performance and scalability reasons, it will be probably
stored externally later.<br>
A lot of the versioning functionality is handled in the NodeImpl or VersionImpl
itself, since it operates on internal properties and node of that nodes. This
also might move to another class, eg. the VersionManager later.<br>
